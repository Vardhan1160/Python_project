# 🌍 Exploring Global Economic Trends with World Bank Data 📊

This project explores long-term trends in global economic indicators using data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). The main focus is on **GDP** and **GDP per capita**, analyzed across different **income groups** over time.

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze how economic indicators like GDP and GDP per capita have evolved across different income groups (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income), using real-world time series data.

## 🔧 What I Did

- 🔹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Handled inconsistencies and missing values
  - Standardized column names and data types

- 🔹 **Missing Value Treatment**
  - Applied **forward fill** and **backward fill** techniques to address missing data

- 🔹 **Data Visualization**
  - Created clear and informative plots using **Matplotlib** to visualize:
    - Long-term trends in GDP by income group
    - Comparative changes in GDP per capita
    - Economic disparities over time

## 📈 Key Insights

Simple visualizations can be incredibly powerful for storytelling. Watching the economic gap between income groups widen or narrow over time was both insightful and eye-opening.

## 💡 Takeaways

Projects like this remind me why I enjoy working with data. Every dataset holds a story — you just have to uncover it.
